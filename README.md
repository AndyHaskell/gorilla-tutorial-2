##Go/Gorilla for MEAN Stack developers part 2: Handlers and middleware

This is the code from the examples in my tutorial on learning about Handlers and middleware chaining in Go/Gorilla from Express.js, which you can `go get` with `go get github.com/AndyHaskell/gorilla-tutorial-2`.  The code is available in both Go and JavaScript.

To run the Go version of the server, run `go get github.com/gorilla/handlers` if you don't have the Gorilla handlers package and `go get github.com/justinas/alice` if you don't have Alice and then from this directory run `go install` and `gorilla-tutorial-2`.  The server listens on port 1123.

To run the Node version, from this directory run `npm install` and then run `node server.js`.  The server listens on port 1123.
